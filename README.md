Title: Optimization of strain-induced superconductivity in RuO2 using physics-informed surrogate models

Abstract: It was recently discovered that the non-superconducting compound RuO$_2$ becomes superconducting under the influence of strain. With the help of Density Functional Theory numerical calculations, the onset of superconductivity was attributed to the increase of the electronic density of states at the Fermi level \cite{ruf_2021_strain_superc}. Searching for other strains that produce superconductivity followed soon after \cite{pamuk_2025_aps}. The search is complicated by the computational cost of DFT simulations, which require supercomputer time. In our work, we introduce physics-informed surrogate models for various electronic properties of RuO$_2$, which allows us to bypass expensive DFT computations while keeping the accuracy within acceptable levels. The application of these surrogate models makes feasible a systematic and expansive search for strains that produce the greatest density of states at the Fermi level. We perform this expansive search and identify strains that could potentially lead to superconductivity. Biaxial tensile strain in the $(001)$ crystal orientation emerges as one of the best possible strains for RuO$_2$ and it is, at the same time, experimentally accessible with the help of biaxial epitaxy.
